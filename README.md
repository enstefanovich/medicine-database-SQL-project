# medicine-database-SQL-project
In this project, I used MySQL to create a small example database of over-the-counter medicines. I also wrote queries to answer specific questions using the data in the database. It contains the following tables: medication information (pharmaceutical info), store information (store name and location), store inventory (a specific medicine/product's information, such as brand name and quantity), and store inventory status (if a medicine is available at a given time and for what price). Realistically, a database like this could be helpful for those looking for looking to find the cheapest option for an OTC medicine near them.
